# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass is a Learning Management System that will provide new drivers, that need to pass their DMV test, with new, relevant, and well delivered information to assist in passing their test. They also will provide in person training. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
What I did well was thagt I hit all the requirements given by the IT team and the manager of DriverPass. Another thing I did well was include other basic functions this system will need in conjuction to the main needs.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would revise the business requirments document to include more detail of what needs to be in the system. To narrow it down more I would make sure the functional and non-functional portions are well documented and detailed.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
At the end of the day we are creating a system that our users are using. They know what they want and how they want it. We can try to give them input, but they have final say and we implement.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I try to break everything down as much as possible and then combine everything to make the big system. Antoher thing I like to do is write it out, it makes me think more and is more organized.
